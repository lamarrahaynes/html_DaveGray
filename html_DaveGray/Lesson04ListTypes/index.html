    <h1>HTML Lists</h1>
    <p>This web page is dedicated to the lists, of which there are three types.</p>

    <h3>Let me tell you about the three types.</h3>
    <p> First, there is the ordered list. See bleow.</p>

    <h4>Example of Ordered List</h4>
    <p>Notice that the ordered list has uses numbers for each list item. </p>
    <ol>
        <li>&hellip;I learn more about web development.</li>
        <li>&hellip; I plan my scheudle.</li>
        <li>&hellip; I use resources like <abbr title="Mozilla Developer Network">MDN.</li>
    </ol>

    <h1>I Am Also Planning a Vacation</h1>

    <p>I have been working hard and <em>really</em> need a getaway</p>

    <p>I live in Oregon and while we have the coast I want to go somewhere with warm beach.</p>

    <hr>
    <h2>Places I would like to visit</h2>

    <p>I will use an unordered list to list out the places I would like to visit. In contrast to an ordered list the unordered list uses bullet points for each list item instead of numbers.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Accra, Ghana</li>
        <li>Dakar, Senegal</li>
        <li>Kerala, India</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h2>Places I want to avoid</h2>
    <p>Anywhere cold!</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>Reasons why I want to visit each place</h2>
    <p>I will use the third and final list type, a descriptive list, to explain why I want to visit each place.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Accra, Ghana</dt>
        <dd>Most Jamaicans are said to have been taken from what is now present day Ghana. As such I would like be on the same land as my ancestors.</dd>
        <dt>Dakar, Senegal</dt>
        <dd>I was told that Sengal is beuatifu and that Senegalese people have a similar disposition to Jamaicans. I would like to experince both for myself.</dd>
        <dt>Kerala, India</dt>
        <dd>Tarik's people are from there and I would like to check it out. Kerala is also called "Queerala" I am curiuous about how queer culture is reperesented there.</dd>
